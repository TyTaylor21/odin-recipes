<p>Ingredients</p>
<ul>
    <li>500 grams potatoes </li>
    <li>6 eggs </li>
    <li>1 large white onion </li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Virgin oil</li>
</ul>
<p> Instructions</p>
<ol>
  <li>Peel the potatoes and rinse them thoroughly under cold water. Slice them thinly using a sharp knife.</li>
  <li>In a large frying pan, heat about Â½ inch of good-quality extra virgin olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the sliced potatoes, making sure they are fully covered with oil. Add more oil if necessary.</li>
  <li>Cook the potatoes gently on low heat for approximately 20 minutes. It's fine if some pieces start to break apart.</li>
  <li>While the potatoes are cooking, crack the eggs into a large bowl, beat them well, and season with a pinch of salt.</li>
  <li>Thinly slice the onion and cook it in a separate pan with a bit of oil over medium heat until it starts to caramelize, about 10 minutes. Add a splash of water occasionally to deglaze the pan and prevent burning. Drain any extra oil and mix the onions into the beaten eggs.</li>
  <li>Once the potatoes have cooled slightly, combine them with the egg and onion mixture. Stir well and let it rest for 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Carefully pour out the oil used to cook the potatoes and save it for another use. Return the pan to medium-low heat and pour in the egg mixture.</li>
  <li>Cook the tortilla gently for about 6 minutes, allowing the bottom to set without burning.</li>
  <li>To flip the tortilla, place a large plate over the pan, flip it quickly, and slide the tortilla back into the pan. It's okay if some egg spills. Cook the other side for another 6 to 8 minutes, until the tortilla is fully set.</li>
